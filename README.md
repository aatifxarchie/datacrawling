This is a project using 'Beautiful Soup' that crawls the webpage - https://openaccess.thecvf.com/ICCV2023?day=all. The webpage contains multiple research papers, their authors, pdf links and many other features. It crawls, collects the paper titles, authors' names and pdf links. These are combined to create a new csv file which is saved in the current working directory.
